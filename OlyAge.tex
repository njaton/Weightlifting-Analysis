 \section{Introduction} 
	This is a quick dive into the age range of olympic athletes, specifically weightlifters. All data used in this study was acquired from Randi H Griffin's "120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results" which is avalible on Kaggle. Upon starting this project it was hypothesized that the age range of both male and female athletes would be in the higher 20's. As it turns out the average gold medalist in weightlifting has an age of 24.59 years.
